## INTRODUCTION

Soul Forest is small 3rd person shooter taking place in a magical forest. The player takes the role of a local spirit whose forest has been invaded by deamons. These deamons have the ability to turn local people into more deamons, so the number of enemies increase as time passes. The player's job is to navigate the world defeating the deamons and collect keys to open doors and access new areas. The palyer starts of with one type of weapon, but two other weapons with different characteristics can be collected. Alternatively, the player can dash into the enemies to inflict a small damage.

Moreover, the world is populated with geckos and deers, which can be domesticated to mount them. The animals will run away at first, but will become friendly if the player gives them sweets. Mounting geckos enables the player to run very fast, whereas riding deer allows to jump very high.
